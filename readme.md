Lychee is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of seconds. Upload, manage and share photos like from a native application. Lychee comes with everything you need and all your photos are stored securely.

## Installation

To run Lychee, everything you need is a web-server with PHP 5.3 or later and a MySQL-Database. Follow the instructions to install Lychee on your server. [Installation &#187;](docs/md/Installation.md)

## How to use

You can use Lychee right after the installation. Here are some advanced features to get the most out of it.

### Settings

Sign in and click the gear on the top left corner to change your settings. If you want to edit them manually: MySQL details are stored in `data/config.php`. Other options and hidden settings are stored directly in the database. [Settings &#187;](docs/md/Settings.md)

### Update

Updating is as easy as it should be.  [Update &#187;](docs/md/Update.md)

### Build

Lychee is ready to use, right out of the box. If you want to contribute and edit CSS or JS files, you need to rebuild Lychee. [Build &#187;](docs/md/Build.md)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts will help you to use Lychee even faster. [Keyboard Shortcuts &#187;](docs/md/Keyboard Shortcuts.md)

### Twitter Cards

Lychee supports [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and [Open Graph](http://opengraphprotocol.org) for shared images (not albums). In order to use Twitter Cards you need to request an approval for your domain. Simply share an image with Lychee, copy its link and paste it in [Twitters Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
