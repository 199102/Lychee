CHANGES

* Improved performance by caching:
- The albums view is stored in memory when changing from the albums to the individual album/photo view.
- When viewing photos, the next picture in the current album is preloaded.

* Default sort order of albums is changed from new to old.

* Fixed scroll position when changing from albums to album and vice versa
